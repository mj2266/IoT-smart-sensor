- Demonstration video: iotdemo.mp4
- Report: IoT assignment2 Report.pdf
- Simulation source code: IoT Wokwi Simulation.zip
- ML model notebook: IoT.ipynb

Instructions on Running ML model:

Programming Language: Python3.6 or above. 
Libraries Used:
        - tensorflow 2.6.0
        - numpy 1.19.5
        - pandas 1.1.5
        - sklearn 


The seeds are added in the notebook, so that the results are reproducible.


How to run the code:
There are two ways the code can be run,
1) 
- one simple approach is to use Google Colab, which already has the packages installed.
- Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ . Here, upload the IoT.ipynb file and open the notebook.
- From the sidebar, click on file icon, then click on "Upload to session storage" button, 
  and upload the IOT_Assignment_2_data_regression_sensor_range.csv file
- Now run the code


2) 
- Code can also run on a local system but will require installing of the packages.
- Once the packages are installed, make sure the IoT.ipynb notebook and dataset IOT_Assignment_2_data_regression_sensor_range.csv file 
  are in same folder, then open the notebook in preferred application
- Run the code.
